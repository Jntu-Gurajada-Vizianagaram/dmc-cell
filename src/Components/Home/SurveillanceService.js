          Surveillance involves systematic monitoring of individuals, groups, or
          activities to gather information, maintain security, or exert control.
          It spans various methods, including physical observation, electronic
          monitoring, and cyber surveillance. Purpose-wise, it enhances security
          by preventing crime, monitoring public spaces for safety, aiding law
          enforcement investigations, and gathering intelligence for
          governments. Technological advancements like high-definition cameras,
          facial recognition, and predictive analytics have bolstered
          surveillance capabilities but raised concerns about privacy and
          ethics. Legal frameworks and ethical considerations strive to balance
          security needs with individual rights, while debates persist over
          issues like mass surveillance, data privacy, and societal impact.
