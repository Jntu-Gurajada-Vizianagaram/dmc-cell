          Hardware encompasses the physical components of computing systems and
          electronic devices, including the central processing unit (CPU),
          memory (RAM), storage devices (e.g., hard disk drives, solid-state
          drives), input and output devices (e.g., keyboards, monitors), and
          networking equipment. It serves as the tangible infrastructure that
          enables computers and devices to perform various tasks and functions.
          Hardware components are designed to work together seamlessly within a
          system, facilitating data processing, storage, communication, and
          interaction with users. Advances in hardware technology drive
          innovation, efficiency, and performance improvements in computing
          systems across diverse applications and industries.
