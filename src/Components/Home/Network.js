          A network is a system of interconnected devices or nodes that
          communicate and share resources. It enables data transmission and
          access to shared services such as internet connectivity, file sharing,
          and printing. Networks can be categorized based on their geographic
          scope, from Local Area Networks (LANs) confined to a small area like a
          home or office, to Wide Area Networks (WANs) spanning large distances,
          such as the internet. Various network technologies, including
          Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and cellular networks, facilitate communication
          between devices, supporting a wide range of applications and services
          essential for modern computing and communication.
