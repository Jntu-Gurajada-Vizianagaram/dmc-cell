        A Digital Monitoring Cell typically refers to a dedicated team or department responsible for 
          overseeing and managing digital activities within the institution. This may include monitoring 
          the college's online presence across various platforms such as websites and social media channels 
          to ensure compliance with institutional policies, promote positive engagement, and address any 
          issues or concerns raised by students, faculty, or the public. Additionally, the Digital Monitoring 
          Cell may play a role in safeguarding the college's digital infrastructure and information systems, 
          ensuring cybersecurity measures are in place to protect sensitive data and mitigate potential cyber 
          threats. Furthermore, they may provide support and guidance to students and faculty on best practices
           for digital communication, online safety, and responsible use of technology. Overall, the Digital 
           Monitoring Cell serves as a vital component in maintaining a secure and conducive digital environment 
           within the college community.
